## Project Objective
To create a Social Network API using a NoSQL database, so that the website will handle large amounts of unstructured data; we will be able to add, update, delete and view specific information using the POST, PUT, DELETE AND GET methods. The specific information that we will be manipulating will be a user, a friend for a user, a thought for a user, a reaction for a thought. Also whenever we delete a user, their associated thoughts will do as well! 

## User Story
AS a social media startup, I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database, SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Technologies 
```
Node.js, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
```

## Installation
You will need to have installed MongoDB, [click here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) for a quick guide to install MongoDB.


## Usage 
To use this app you will need to download and install the Terminal  GitBash for Windows. You may also need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) and [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to test the project. You will open the project in the code editor of your choice and then open the terminal and type "npm install" or "npm i" to install all the dependencies required. After installing MongoDB, on your terminal or GitBash you will need to type "mongod" to start the server, this will allow a successfully connection with the project. Finally you will be able to start the project typing "npm start" on your terminal or GitBash. And that is it, now you are able to test the code with insomnia!
